# Note: there should be NO "commit" checks in the node.def hierarchy for
#       vrrp because all the error checking is done on the end nodes.  A
#       "commit" check that fails in the node.def will prevent the "end"
#       node from getting called and the "changes" file will get out of
#       sync.
